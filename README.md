## ✨ Key Features

### 🔐 1. Role-Based UI (RBAC)
- **Admin Mode:** Full access to view, add, and delete transactions.
- **Viewer Mode:** Read-only access. The "Add Transaction" section and "Delete" actions are completely unmounted from the UI to ensure a clean user experience for non-admin users.

### 📊 2. Dynamic Data Visualization
- **Balance Trend:** A line chart showing the cumulative balance over time with interactive tooltips.
- **Spending Breakdown:** A modern Donut chart visualizing expenses across categories (Food, Transport, Salary, etc.).
- **Responsive Charts:** Built using `Recharts` with `ResponsiveContainer` to ensure clarity on all screen sizes from mobile to desktop.

### 💡 3. Intelligent Insights Engine
- Automatically identifies the **Highest Spending Category**.
- Calculates **Total Monthly Expenses** in real-time.
- Provides a visual **Progress Bar** for budget allocation analysis and observation-based feedback.

### 💾 4. Data Persistence & Management
- **Local Storage:** Integrated `localStorage` to ensure data remains intact even after a page refresh.
- **Pagination:** Handles datasets efficiently with a 5-item-per-page limit and smooth navigation.
- **Search & Filter:** Real-time searching by category and filtering by transaction type (Income/Expense).

### 📥 5. One-Click Export
- **JSON Export:** Download the entire transaction history in structured JSON format.
- **CSV Export:** Professional CSV formatting for spreadsheet analysis (Excel/Google Sheets).
### 🎨 6. Modern UI/UX Design
- **Tailwind CSS:** Clean, responsive design with full Dark Mode support.
- **Framer Motion:** Smooth animations for row entry and transitions.
- **Iconography:** Utilizes Lucide React / Heroicons for a polished look.
